*** Processor Status Flag Register(P) - Reference ***
|1/0|  ; Carry Flag
|1/0|  ; Zero Flag
|1/0|  ; IRQ Disable Flag
|1/0|  ; Decimal Mode Flag
|1/0|  ; Break Command Flag
|***|  ; Unused bit
|1/0|  ; Overflow Flag
|1/0|  ; Negative Flag

Numbers System Prefixes
# ; Decimal Number
$ ; Hexadecimal Number
% ; Binary number

Modes
LDA #80  ; (Immediate Mode) When the number is prefixed with # this loads the register with the literal decimal value 80
LDA $80  ; (Absolute (Zero Page) Mode) When the number is prefixed with $ this loads the register with the value that is in memory address $80
LDA #$80 ; (Immediate Mode) loads the register with the literal hexadecimal value with the hexadecimal number 80

processor <processor name> ; tells the assembler what processor will be the target of the code
seg code ; tells the assembler this is a segment of code
org ; defines the code origin at a specific memory address

LD<Register> ;Loads a register with a value
ST<Register> ;Takes a value in a register and stores it in memory

ADC ; add to the accumulator
    ; with carry
SBC ; subtract from the accumulator
    ; with carry
^   CLC ; clears the carry flag and usually is performed before addition
    SEC ; Sets the carry flag and is usually performed before subtraction

IN<Register> ; Increments a register and is similar to ++
DE<Register> ; Decrements a register and is similar to --
DEC          ; Decrements memory
^   ; Sets processor status flags
    z = 1 if 0 ; otherwise 1
    N = if 7 bit (sign bit) is 1; 0 otherwise

JMP is like GOTO another line of code

Branches

BCC  ; Branch if carry flag is 0 ; c == 0
BCS  ; Branch if carry flag is 1 ; c == 1
BEQ  ; Branch if zero flag is 1  ; z == 0
BNE  ; Branch if zero flag is 0  ; z == 1
BMI  ; Branch on minus           ; N == 1
BPL  ; Branch on plus            ; N == 0
BVC  ; Branch on overflow clear  ; V == 0
BVS  ; Branch on overflow set    ; V == 1

Transfer

txs         ; Transfers the X register to the (S)tack pointer
