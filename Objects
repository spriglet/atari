Background
* Takes the whole visible screen (160X192)
* Can only change the background color per each horizontal scanline ( COLUBK)
* The background is always displayed by other elements


TIA Objects

Playfield
* 20-bit pattern, rendered over the left side of the scanline. (The left 80 color clocks of the scan line)
* one color per horizontal scanline
* the ride side will either repeat or reflect the same pattern
  Address Alias Names
   * (P0, P1, P2)
   * COLUPF
   * CTRLPF 5 bits     |D5|D4|D2|D1|D0
     * D0: Reflect (On Reflect, Off Repeat)
     * D1: Score
     * D2: Priority (Is it going to appear behind or in front of player0 or player1 for example)
     * D4-D5: Ball size (1, 2, 3, 4)

Things that are part of the Playfield in tank
(The scores, the walls around the screen, walls)
PF0 = 0000 <-- <-- order
PF1 = 0000 0000 order --> -->
PF2 = 0000 0000 <-- <-- order
REFLECT = 0



Player
Each is an 8-bit pattern
(GRP0,GRP1) with a foreground color (COLUP0, COLUP1)  that can be positioned at any
column of the scanline.
10100001 -> O O    O

Each player can be horizontally stretched, multiplied, or inverted
NUSIZ0, NUSIZ1 (number/size) of the player
REFP0, REFP1 (reflect player)


Missles/Balls
*Can be positioned just like players, but no bit pattern
* Just one pixel, but it can be horizontally stretched (2x, 4x, 8x)
* M0 and M1 use P0/P1 colors
* BL uses the PF foreground color
* We have limitations of up to 2 missiles only on the same
