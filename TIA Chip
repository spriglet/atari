In modern browser the entire frames pixel configuration was stored in memory.
For the Atari memory is expensive and you could only program one line
or a scanline.

When ever the beam goes to the right and turns off and realigns again this is
called the horizontal blank

horizontal blanks 68 color clock cycles
other 160 color clocks (pixels)

TIA is 3.8 megahertz

To control when a scanline finishes, the processor is halted until it
receives WSYNC signal from the TIA

Whenever we hit (meaning we write any value) a certain address in memory it stops and waits for the TIA chip to receive a
W synchronization flag. When the TIA chip is finsihed it releases the WSYNC flag
and the processor resumes it's execution.

Vertical Sync Line - has a time which is called the vertical sync which is
three scan lines and this vertical sync tells the vcs when the frame starts and
when the frame ends.

Vertical Blank is a thirty seven scanline long and it is a buffer that you
have to put on top of your rendering before you start rendering your visible
lines.

Overscanlines are the scanlines we render after the visible scan lines

Vertical Sync    3 scanlines
Vertical Blank  37 scanlines
Visible        192 scanlines
Overscan        30 scanlines


228 color clocks and 76 CPU cycles per scanline
which is 3 color clocks per CPU cycle


Colors are in hex numbers
$CF (C is luminance and the F is the Hue)
luminance is Luminance is a photometric measure of brightness ( the luminous intensity per unit area of light travelling in a given direction. It describes the amount of light that .
Hue is how dark or light the color is).
